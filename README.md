There is a serious problem with the state of simple development tools on the internet. 
Most of the websites providing simple encoders/decoders/formatters/prettifiers are filled with ads and popups which makes it difficult and risky to use.
And then there is also a huge problem with privacy and leaking any private data that is used on any of these websites.

[DevRider](https://github.com/namuan/dev-rider) is an attempt to provide a desktop tool which includes a shell and addins for various utilities.
